# To Do List

👷🏻‍♂️⚠️ Under construction

This is a simple exercise built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. The to-do list takes the data entered by the user and incorporates it into a list that will contain a button to mark whether the task is complete or not. You will be able to see the progress of your progress at the top, and you can also start the application again with the "reset" button.

The application is under development and in search of improvements, the objective is to practice **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. Any collaboration is welcome 👨🏻‍💻.
